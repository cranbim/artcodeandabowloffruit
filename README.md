# Art, Code and a Bowl of Fruit
You may think you can't code a computer and you can't draw. We are here to show you can (and you can!).

We will take you step by step to create your own digital paiting tool. It's only a few lines of code, and you will learn so much.
Even better, once everyone has a digital paintbrush, we will try and draw what we see. It's a lot of fun and you will surprise yourself.

You will need a computer with a web browser to take part. You will create everything else!

See you there.

Pete, Alice & Dave
